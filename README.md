[ Lightweight-IDS-for-Wireless-IP-Camera ]

A Security Lightweight Intrusion Detection System monitors and protects Tapo IP Camera against Network Threads 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## üìå Overview  
This project addresses critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities in **wireless IP cameras** (e.g., Tapo, Ezviz, Xiaomi) connected to home/office Wi-Fi networks. These devices are often targeted by **botnets, DoS/DDoS attacks, and unauthorized access** due to weak default security.  

The solution implements a **lightweight Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using **Suricata NIDS** on a Windows GUI environment, optimized for real-time threat detection without compromising device performance.

## üéØ Key Features  
- **Hybrid Detection:** Combines **signature-based** (Suricata rules) and **anomaly-based** methods to identify attacks like Mirai botnets, brute force, and RTSP exploits.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Minimal CPU/memory usage, tailored for low-power IoT devices.  
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Instant notifications for suspicious activities (e.g., unauthorized access).  
- **Scalability:** Adaptable to multi-camera setups and other IoT devices.  
- **Open-Source:** Uses Suricata, Wireshark, and Tapo camera APIs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation  
### Tools & Technologies  
- **Suricata NIDS:** Core detection engine with custom rules for IoT threats.  
- **Wireshark:** Packet capture and traffic analysis.  
- **Tapo IP Camera (TC70):** Test device in a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network.  
- **Windows GUI:** User-friendly interface for non-technical users.  

### Workflow  
1. **Data Collection:** Capture network traffic via Wireshark (PCAP files).  
2. **Threat Detection:** Suricata analyzes traffic for malicious patterns.  
3. **Alerting:** Logs and alerts are generated for anomalies (e.g., DoS attempts).  
4. **Visualization:** LogViewPlus and Kibana for monitoring.

## üìä Results  
- Successfully detected **malware attacks, botnet traffic, and port scanning**.  
- **<Lowest performance impact** on camera streaming quality.  
- **Accurate detection rate** with optimized Suricata rules.
